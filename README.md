A backend for [node-workflow](http://kusor.github.com/node-workflow/) built
over [Moray](http://).

# Installation

npm install wf-moray-backend

# Usage

Add the following to the config file of your application using wf:

    {
      "backend": {
        "module": "wf-moray-backend",
        "opts": {
          "port": 8080,
          "host": "127.0.0.1",
          "connectTimeout": 1000
        }
      }
    }

Where `port` and `host` are obviously related to your redis server and `db` is
the Redis Database you want to use. If your Moray server is password protected,
add also `"password": "whatever"` to the configuration section above. 

And that should be it. `wf` REST API and Runners should take care of
properly loading the module on init.
