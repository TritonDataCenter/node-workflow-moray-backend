A backend for [node-workflow](http://kusor.github.com/node-workflow/) built
over [Moray](http://).

# Installation

    npm install wf-moray-backend

      ^
      |__ Not yet :-)

# Usage

Add the following to the config file of your application using wf:

    {
      "backend": {
        "module": "wf-moray-backend",
        "opts": {
          "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
          "connectTimeout": 1000
        }
      }
    }

Where `url` is the url where moray server is listening.

And that should be it. `wf` REST API and Runners should take care of
properly loading the module on init.

# Testing

### Setup a `moray_test` db from manatee zone:

    [root@headnode (coal) ~]# sdc-login manatee
    [root@... (coal:manatee0) ~]# createdb -U postgres moray_test
    [root@... (coal:manatee0) ~]# psql -U postgres moray_test
    moray_test=# CREATE TABLE buckets_config (
        name text PRIMARY KEY,
        index text NOT NULL,
        pre text NOT NULL,
        post text NOT NULL,
        options text,
        mtime timestamp without time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
    );


### Boot another moray instance pointing to the `moray_test` db:

    [root@headnode (coal) ~] sdc-login moray
    [root@... (coal:moray0) ~]# cd /opt/smartdc/moray/
    [root@... (coal:moray0) /opt/smartdc/moray]# cp etc/config.json etc/config.test.json
    [root@... (coal:moray0) /opt/smartdc/moray]# cp smf/manifests/moray.xml smf/manifests/moray-test.xml

Then, you need to modify SMF to make this moray test instance to use our `moray_test` db
and listen into a different port:

0. Change service name from `moray` to `moray-test` at the very top of the manifest:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE service_bundle SYSTEM "/usr/share/lib/xml/dtd/service_bundle.dtd.1">
    <service_bundle type="manifest" name="smartdc-moray-test">
        <service name="smartdc/application/moray-test" type="service" version="1">

1. Make sure the `start` method `exec` attribute has the following value:

    exec="node main.js -f etc/config.json -p 2222 &amp;"

2. Add `MORAY_DB_NAME` to the `start` method environment:

    <envvar name="MORAY_DB_NAME" value="moray_test" />

3. Import the new service:

    svccfg import smf/manifests/moray-test.xml

You should have a new moray instance running at the moray zone on port 2222 now. For
COAL this means your moray URL will be `http://10.99.99.17:2222`.
